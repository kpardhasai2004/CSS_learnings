COLOUR SELECTION :

In CSS there are different types of colour.

There are 1.RGB 2.RGBA 3.HEXADEIMAL

RGB: In this the colour is decided on the value of red, green and blue.

RGBA: This is also same as RGB but the difference is we can select opacity usingvalue of A

HEXADECIMAL: The colour is selected on the basis on the hexadecimal value specially numbers ranges from 
	           0 to 9 and alphabets ranges from A to F.

 
CSS Specificity:

In this the style to the object is applied on the basis of specificity order.

Inline > id > classes	                > Elements & Pseudo-elements
	    attributes&
	    pseudo-classes

CSS Units:

Absolute Unit:

This is not recomended.
In this since the value is fixed when there is a change in the size of the screen it won't appear properly.
example: px,cm,mm,etc

Relative Units: 

This is mostly prefered for web devlopment.
the size changes relatively according to the web browser gives proper view to the user.
example: vmin,vh,vw
